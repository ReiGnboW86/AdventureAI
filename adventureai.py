Adventure AI - Choose Your Own Adventure Game Framework

This project defines the foundation for an interactive 'choose your own adventure' game called Adventure AI. 
The game is powered by multiple AI agents via OpenAI's Swarms framework and provides an immersive experience 
with dynamic storytelling, visuals, and audio.

General Game Structure:
------------------------
- The game is displayed in a comic book-style GUI with:
  1. A text box showing the current scene's description.
  2. A graphical panel rendering dynamic images of the scene and player's character.
  3. An input field for the player to type their actions.
  4. Ambient background music and sound effects to enhance immersion.

Core Features:
--------------
1. AI Agents (powered by OpenAI Swarms framework):
   - **TextAgent**:
     - Processes player input to dynamically generate story scenes.
     - Maintains context and adapts the narrative using a PostgreSQL-based vector database.
   - **ImageAgent**:
     - Utilizes StableDiffusion 1.5 to:
       - Create a 512x512 image of the player's character based on their description (name, gender, and appearance).
       - Generate scene images that incorporate the player's character and actions.
   - **SoundAgent**:
     - Plays sound effects based on player actions (e.g., sword swings, hugs, musical notes).
     - Dynamically adjusts background music intensity according to the scene's tone.

2. Player Customization and Persistence:
   - Players create their character (name, gender, appearance) at the start.
   - The character's image is saved and reused in future scenes.

3. Interactive Storytelling:
   - The game dynamically responds to player choices while maintaining story continuity.
   - Includes a dice-roll mechanic for chance-based actions, with accompanying sound effects.

Technical Details:
------------------
1. Implemented in Python with:
   - A GUI framework (e.g., PyQt or Tkinter) for the comic book-style interface.
   - PostgreSQL as the backend database for vectorized memory storage and retrieval.
   - StableDiffusion for image generation.
   - A sound library (e.g., PyGame or simpleaudio) for audio playback.

2. Modular, Extensible Design:
   - Code is organized into classes or modules for agents, GUI, and database interactions.
   - Includes comprehensive comments and documentation for each component.
   - Provides instructions for environment setup (e.g., installing OpenAI Swarms, StableDiffusion, PostgreSQL, and sound libraries).

3. Extensibility:
   - Future developers can easily add new agents, sounds, or gameplay mechanics due to the modular architecture.

Deliverables:
-------------
- A complete, well-documented Python codebase.
- Instructions for:
  - Initializing and running the game.
  - Setting up and connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
  - Understanding how agents interact with player inputs and the game environment.
