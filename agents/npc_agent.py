Takes input from:

Gives output to:


When the player encounters a central NPC for the story this agent should
(together with the DatabaseAgent) store their personality and traits if
you encounter the NPC longer in the story.

When first encountering this NPC, draw an image using ImageAgent to show
the player how this NPC looks.
